# Will-Sather

Hello -

Thank you for taking the time to come look at my code and the work I have been putting into my programming experience.  

As of right now, I have committed a Keyword Generator project (which is written in Python 3) and a COVID-19 Windows application demo (written in C# in Visual Studio).  

The COVID-19 Windows application demo is my most recent project which was built out of boredom during my quarantined semester.  I essentially developed an app that parses website's HTML to find the most up-to-date coronavirus statistics, plots the numbers, and also provides resources and information regarding the virus.  This was also meant for me to develop a more working knowledge of C# as well as Visual Studio. 

The Google Ads Keyword Generator was written and utilized during my time as Creatively Innovative, a digital marketing and data analytics agency in Chanhassen, MN.  I wrote this code to be able to save a consistent amount of time and busy work.  During the onboarding process for our clients, we would build out custom keywords for different campaigns and ad groups.  This project made it easier to generate long-tail keywords that included personalized city names and states.  At the end of the day, this was intended to be a quick fix to a problem at work, but I feel is a good example of my coding style and an example of some Python programming

Along with that, I also have committed some examples of data structures I have worked on in Java.  This is a great demonstration of the learning I have been doing at UMN.  

Finally, the last thing committed on here is my personal website / resume (HTML 5 hosted on the Netlify through GitHub).  Included is the raw source code (I started with an HTML template and went from there) - just a fun project to work on. If you want to view the hosted version, it is available at https://sather.ws 

Thanks again and don't be hesitant to reach out!
