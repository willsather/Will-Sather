## Project Description
This project is quite special to me as it was the first true coding project that I ever worked on.  It was during my senior year of high school where I got to choose a project group where a three man team got to work on any project they so choose.  Our group worked on creating the front and backend of a java based Bingo game.  By the time we got so far, we ended up creating the ability to simulate games using an "AI" so we could make some calculations on win percentages and such.  I still include this project so I can look back and admire my self improvement, but also because it was the first time I had a fully functioning "product" built with code.
