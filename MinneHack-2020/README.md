## Project Description
During my fall semester of sophomore year, I went out on a limb with some friends and joined a 24 hour coding competition.  On a saturday night, we were "locked" into the student union and were designated to use some form of coding to solve a problem.  The problem was "a solution that ables people to give back to society or the community".  Although we didn't come up with a fully functioning product at the end of 24 hours, we still partcipated and managed to have some form of code to submit at the end.  Nothing has ever come from it yet, but we can look back today and admire how much we have improved as coders and software engineers.
